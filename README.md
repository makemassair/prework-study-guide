# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Study Guide has been created for students who have been going through the Prework modules. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. It serves as an introduction to these 4 parts of front end web development. I've learnt the basics of each of them, in the case of git and JavaScript, for the first time.

If we open Chrome  DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) a console panel will open. There you will see the list of topics we learned from the prework part of this bootcamp, along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
